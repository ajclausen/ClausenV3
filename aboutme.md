## Executive Summary

**The Journey:**
Started with zero technical experience at Apprentice University, progressing through 6+ company apprenticeships over 2.5 years. Each role built upon the last—from basic WordPress maintenance to building complex distributed systems. The pinnacle came when Flexware's client, ECO Parking Technologies, hired me directly as their first full-time technical employee.

**Current Impact:**
As System Engineer at ECO, I single-handedly manage network infrastructure for 50+ parking facilities nationwide, including a massive Las Vegas casino with 693 sensors. I've modernized our architecture (saving thousands in monthly fees), built three production applications, and established myself as the technical foundation of our smart parking platform.

**Technical Evolution:**
- **Started**: Basic WordPress, zero Linux/networking knowledge
- **Learned**: Full-stack development, cloud architecture, IoT systems
- **Built**: React/TypeScript apps, Ruby microservices, infrastructure automation
- **Now Leading**: Network design, system architecture, technical strategy

**What Sets Me Apart:**
1. **Self-Directed Growth**: Taught myself fiber optics via YouTube to solve 10G backhaul challenges
2. **Business Acumen**: Built tools that directly impact sales efficiency and operational costs
3. **End-to-End Ownership**: From building physical gateways to deploying cloud infrastructure
4. **Proven Track Record**: Successfully transitioned from apprentice to irreplaceable technical lead

**Next Chapter:**
Pursuing BSNES degree while continuing to expand ECO's technical capabilities. My goal is to formalize the extensive practical knowledge I've gained while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in smart city infrastructure.

## Refined Portfolio Entries

### Polished "About Me" for Portfolio

I'm a self-taught System Engineer who transformed from zero technical knowledge into the sole network architect for 50+ smart parking facilities nationwide. My unconventional path through Apprentice University's hands-on program taught me that the best solutions come from understanding both the technical details and business impact.

At ECO Parking Technologies, I've built the infrastructure that powers some of the nation's largest parking deployments, including a 693-sensor Las Vegas casino requiring custom 10G fiber solutions. When our legacy system threatened to limit our growth, I led the migration to a modern Cloudflare-based architecture, eliminating vendor lock-in and saving thousands monthly.

Beyond infrastructure, I'm a builder at heart. I've created production applications that our teams use daily—from a React-based cost calculator that speeds up sales quotes to a full-stack project tracker that integrates with legacy systems. Each tool solves real problems I've experienced firsthand.

My technical toolkit spans from low-level Linux administration to modern web frameworks, but what sets me apart is my approach: when I encounter a challenge, I don't wait for someone else to solve it. Whether it's teaching myself fiber optics through YouTube or building a Ruby microservice to bridge incompatible systems, I find a way forward.

Currently pursuing my BSNES degree to formalize my practical experience, I'm excited about the intersection of IoT, cloud infrastructure, and smart city technology. I believe the best engineering happens when you deeply understand the problem space—and I've been in the trenches long enough to know what works.

**Core Technologies:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Linux, Ubiquiti, Cloudflare  
**Interests:** IoT infrastructure, smart city technology, developer tooling, system automation
